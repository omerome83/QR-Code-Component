### What I learned

While this was not a difficult project, I must say that I learned a bit doing it.

I never knew what a modern css reset was until I took a look at a comment from another user and read up on it. This really came in handy - especially when it comes to images, as figuring out how to manipulate images without it was very frustrating. It is also good to modify the line-height on certain elements to increase readability.

Also, reading up more on Semantic HTML has given me a better understanding between a section element vs. an article element.

### Useful resources

- [A Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - A great source explaning in detail about how to do a modern css reset.

- [Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#Enter_HTML5_structural_elements) - Great resource on understanding what Semantic HTML is.
